# TempConversion
This project aims to read Fahrenheit temperatures from a file named "FahrenheitTemperature.txt", convert them to Celsius, and then write the city 
names along with their corresponding Celsius temperatures to another file named "CelsiusTemperature.txt". 
Essentially, it's a temperature conversion program that automates the process for a list of cities.

Strengths

Error handling: The code checks if the input and output files are successfully opened, and if not, it prints an error message and exits gracefully.
Readability: The code is fairly easy to read and understand, with meaningful variable names and comments explaining the purpose of each section.

Areas for Enhancement

Input validation: There's no input validation for the temperatures read from the file. Adding validation to ensure that only valid temperatures are 
processed would improve the robustness of the program.
Exception handling: Implementing exception handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, could make the code more secure and resilient to unexpected 
errors during file operations or temperature conversion.

Transferable Skills

File I/O operations: Skills related to reading from and writing to files are highly transferable and applicable to various programming projects.

Maintainability and Readability

Meaningful variable names: Using descriptive names like "inputFile" and "outputFile" enhances code readability.
Comments: Clear comments explain the purpose of each section, making it easier for others to understand the code.
